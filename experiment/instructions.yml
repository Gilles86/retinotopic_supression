  - INSTRUCTIONS -

  In this experiment, you will encounter arrays of colored bars.
  Your job on every trial will be to find the bar
  that has a different orientation than all the others.
  |||||-||

  Once you have found this bar, you will need to report whether
  this uniquely oriented bar has a grey dot inside it.

  If it has a dot, then you need to press the 'left' button.
  if it doesnt have a dot, then you will need to press the
  'up' direction button

  While you do this task, it is very important that you 
  do not move your eyes!

  -- the next screen will have an example of the test array --

    - EXAMPLE TRIAL 1 -

    Here's what a trial display looks like.

    Do you notice that one of the lines is vertical and the others
    are horizontal? This is your search target.

    Notice that there is a grey dot inside this line? On this trial,
    a correct answer would be to press the 'left' button.

    - EXAMPLE TRIAL 2 -

    Here's is another example trial. This one includes a 
    color distractor. That is the green bar. 
    This color distractor is there to mess you up!
    Try to ignore it and focus on the oriented bar 
    that is your target. 

    You probably also noticed that the colors switched, 
    so now your search target is orange. 
    This happens randomly on every trial. Color is never 
    important in this experiment, only orientations!

    On this trial, your target doesnt have a grey dot inside it.
    The correct answer on this trial is therefore to press the 'up' button

    - EXAMPLE TRIAL 3 -

    While you are doing this search task,
    a checkardboard bar will slowly move across
    the screen. This has nothing to do with your task,
    so you can safely ignore it.

    We use this checkardboard to measure your visual system
    while you are doing the task. You can ask the experimenter
    for more information about this if you are interested.

  - SUMMARY -

  Sometimes there will be a long break between
  search trials (a couple seconds). So just wait!

  Notably, the block will start with 15 seconds of just fixation,
  so just at the begining, expect to just
  stare at the fixation dot for a while and wait for the trials to start :)


summary: |
  - SUMMARY -

  So thats it! Your job is to identify the
  bar with a unique orientation and report
  whether it contains a dot. While you do
  this, you will sometimes need to ignore
  a color distractor.

  You will also sometimes see a slowly
  moving checkardbaord at the middle of
  the screen. This is unrelated to your
  task and can be ignored.

  - REMINDER -

  While doing this task it is extremely important 
  that you.
  DONT MOVE YOUR EYES!

  If you move your eyes then we will need
  to throw out that trial! It is always
  better to get a trial wrong than to move
  your eyes.

  Now if you are ready, lets start the trials!

  -- WARNING if you press a button now you will start the real experiment trials --

break: |
  - TIME FOR A BREAK! -

  You have just completed a block of trials. Great job!

  Take a moment to rest your eyes.

fin: |
  - YOURE FINISHED -

  You have just completed the whole experimental session! Great job!

  If this was training, then the experimenter will now let you know
  if your eye control was good enough to proceed with the scanning sessions.

  If this was a scanning session then you will now be ejected from the 
  expensive magnetic tube

    - WELCOME BACK! -

    Weclome to the MRI sessions of this experiment!
    The fact that you are here means that you were very 
    good at keeping your eyes still. So you should
    be proud of that!!

    We will now do six blocks of the exact same
    task you did in the eyetracker labs, but now you
    are laying in a big magnet.

    Press any button to jump back into the task!
